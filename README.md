# [**Scientific calculator**](https://umarbeknasimov.github.io/calculator/) 

* ## Functionalities
    * Grouping: 1 * (2 + 3)
    * Basic arithmetic
    * Sin function (could implement other trig functions with same process)
    * Log, ln functions
    * Exponential functions, with ^2, ^3 shortcuts
    * Adds calculations to history, can retrieve calculation by clicking on it
    * Can use keyboard for number inputs and basic functions
			
* ## Notes
    * Calculator will display "Error with Expression" if expression is invalid
    * All parenthesis must be closed if opened (will work on automating this later)
    * Toggle functions (history, memory for example) do not work
    * All other functions that don't work are grayed out
    * Multiplication must be specified with *
